             Before R.A. No. 9344 was enacted, children at risk 
and CICL were treated much like adult offenders as 
when former President Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. 
signed into law the Judiciary Reorganization Act 
1980
         </li>
         <ul>
           - which abolished the juvenile and domestic 
relations courts. As such child offenders were 
subjected to the same adversarial proceedings 
as their adult counterparts
         </ul>
         <li>
             As an offshoot of the United Nations Convention
on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the R.A. No. 
9344 - intends to deal with these children without 
resorting to judicial proceedings.
         </li>
         <ul>
             -   Instead of punishing juvenile offenders and 
treating them as criminals, these child 
offenders will be provided by the State and the 
community with assistance to prevent them 
from committing future offences
