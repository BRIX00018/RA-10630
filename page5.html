            <h2>Diversion and Intervention Programmes</h2>
            <li>
                During the diversion process, the responsibility and 
treatment of CICL will be determined on the basis of 
his/her social, cultural, economic, psychological or 
educational background without resorting to formal 
court proceedings
            </li>
            <li>
                If the CICL is found to be responsible for an offence, 
he/she will be required to undergo diversion 
programmes without resorting to formal court 
proceedings.
            </li>
            <li>
                During the intervention programmes on the other hand, 
they will undergo a series of activities to address issues 
that caused them to commit an offence.
            </li>
            <li>
                These may take the form of counselling, skills training, 
and education.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:10px">
                The bigger the role these diversion and intervention 
programmes play in child behaviour development, the 
more acceptance and social legitimacy these 
programmes are likely to enjoy in resolving progs.
